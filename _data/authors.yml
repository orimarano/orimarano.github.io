    Hello! My name is Oriana Marano. I'm a web software developer from Argentina.

    I've been working full remotely since 2020 side to side with other teams in the engineer, business analytics and design frameworks.
    My current job involves a precise and critic time management due to a mix of these work types and roles, between managing a consultant team, learning DevOps workflows and designing the AWS team strategies.

    Nowadays I'm focused on improving my cloud skills in the technical side and soft skills when managing a team or communication with clients.
